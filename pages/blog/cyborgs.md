(Video) Talk given at UXPA Boston 2015 in which I talked about three things: The first is the philosophical discipline of phenomenology. The second is what that has to do with how we use tools, and hence, with how we should design tools. The third is that neuroscientist say that the philosophers already got it right like a hundred years ago.
