synopsis: A brain hack is identifying a neuronal mechanism that was evolutionary (probably) developed to do one thing, and then exploiting or hijacking this mechanism to do another. In this talk, I will present one exemplary model mechanism, how we hacked it, and the surprising results we found.

On this year's [Chaos Communication Congress](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011) I had the opportunity to try out a new angle on sensory substitution with a short lightning talk.Â 

> _**Abstract:** A brain hack is identifying a neuronal mechanism that was evolutionary (probably) developed to do one thing, and then exploiting or hijacking this mechanism to do another. While not being a novel idea as such, advances in neuroscience have allowed us to model a number of such mechanisms that are particularly prone to being "hacked". What annoys me however, is that if you google for "brain hacks" you will find loads of "brain improvement tips", yet no satisfactory explanation how and why these so-called hacks shall work. In this talk, I will present one exemplary model mechanism, how we hacked it, and the surprising results we found._

There's only that much information and ideas you can fit into 6 minutes (even if you're a ruthlessly fast talker as I am), but it features Luis Armstrong and an Orc wielding a sledgehammer to teach Latin grammar (thanks to [Nico](https://mobile.twitter.com/#!/thecreativemind) for supplying the superb visuals). It's also a [Pecha Kucha Talk](http://www.pecha-kucha.org/what), meaning I had 20 slides which were shown for 20 seconds each, precisely. Considering that it didn't take me much longer per slide to put the talk together it went off quite well:
