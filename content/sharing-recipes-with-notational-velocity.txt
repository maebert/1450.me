If you're a Mac user and productivity geek, you'll already know [NVAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/) (n√©e [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/)). I won't go into detail why it is the best not taking tool around (other people [have](http://jamesmichie.com/blog/2010/09/notational-velocity-freedom-to-write/) [done](http://mnmlist.com/nv/) [so](http://simplellama.com/notational-velocity/) [already](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/notational-velocity-creating-notes-speed-light-mac/)). Bottom line is: NVAlt is a text editor that lets you store your notes as plain text files in a Dropbox folder and offers full-text search through all your note. And it's dead simple.

Better still: you can share that Dropbox folder with your friends and have effectively a private wiki. That got me the idea of managing all my recipes with NVAlt as well (I was using [SousChef](http://acaciatreesoftware.com/) before, using only 15% of its feature set). And share them with friends who love cooking as much as I do.

The obvious advantages are: 

- All recipes in your folder come from trusted sources. 
- You can identify the author and call them if you have questions. 
- You will still be able to read plain text files in 2052. On any platform.
- You can collaboratively improve recipes, make notes, etc.
- Full-text search allows you to search by tags, ingredients, ...


**Pro Tip**: If you're using several instances of NVAlt, you will need to change the so-called bundle identifier of each copy (except the original one), otherwise they will interfere with each other. To do so, go to your Applications folder, make a copy of `NVAlt.app`, rename it e.g. to `Recipes.app`, right-click and select `Show Package Contents`, and open the file `Info.plist` in the `Contents` subdirectory with your favourite text editor. There, look for a line that says `<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>`. Change the next line to something of your choice; I simply used `<string>de.portwempreludium.recipes</string>`. Save and close. Now your original NVAlt and your recipes app will store their "Interim Note Changes" in different locations. 

**Pro Tip II:** The Markdown preview that comes with NVAlt is fully customisable, and it loads jQuery anyway. One could use this to parse the recipe and add controls for adjusting quantities to yield more servings or convert units. Anybody interested?
