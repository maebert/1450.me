A brain hack is identifying a neuronal mechanism that was evolutionary (probably) developed to do one thing, and then exploiting or hijacking this mechanism to do another. In this pecha kucha talk at the Chaos Communication Congress 2011, I will present one exemplary model mechanism, how we hacked it, and the surprising results we found. There's also a metaphor involving an ogre with a sledgehammer.
